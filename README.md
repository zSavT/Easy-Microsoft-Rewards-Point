# Easy-Microsoft-Rewards-Point

This small program allows you to automatically search for bing to earn Microsoft Rewards points.<p>

Once the program has started, check if it has already started the same day. If so, it will close, if not, it will mark that you have already started and then it will start to open the bing pages. After 10 seconds they will close automatically.<p>

To automate the process 100%, it is advisable to insert the file into the folder "__C: Programdata Microsoft Windows Start Menu Programs Startup__".

To make the program work, you need to start the batch file as an administrator to install and move all the files.
